# About URLs and Host headers:
# This VCL will use the following conventions:
# `req.url` - The canonical URL, will be used to determine the hash of the object
# `req.http.X-Orig-URL` - The URL as received from the client
# `req.http.X-Backend-URL` - The URL as should be sent to the origin (backend)
#
# Having `req.url` be canonical, vs `X-Backend-URL` being what's sent to origin 
# allows us to do restarts to find content on other origins, and use origin
# specific URLs, yet have the object stored under a single hash, meaning that 
# a cache lookup will find the proper object on the first attempt once an 
# object is in the cache.
#
# So `req.url` is what should be left after filtering query string parameters,
# doing normalizations, etc. Then `req.http.X-Backend-URL` is a transformation of
# that, using the origin specific rewriting, etc.
#
# Domain names are handled a bit simpler:
# `req.http.Host` - The canonical domain name for the site, used for the hash
# `req.http.X-Orig-Host` - The original domain name from the client
#
# `bereq.http.Host` will be set based on the backend used.
#
# When forwarding the request from edge POP to shield POP, the original URL and
# original domain name will be used.

# VCL extension points
